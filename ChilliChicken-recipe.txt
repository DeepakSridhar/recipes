Ingredients

350 gm boneless chicken, diced
1 egg, slightly beaten
1/2 cup corn flour
1/2 tsp garlic paste
1/2 tsp ginger paste
1 Tbsp salt or to taste
Oil for deep frying
2 cups onions, thickly sliced
2 tsp green chillies, thickly sliced (remove seeds if too hot)
1 Tbsp soy sauce (adjust according to strength)
2 Tbsp vinegar
Green chillies, slit, for garnish 

Procedure

Mix together the chicken, egg, cornflour, ginger and garlic paste, 2 tsp salt, and enough water so that the chicken pieces are coated with the batter. Leave this for about 30 minutes.

Heat oil in a wok or a pan and deep-fry the chicken pieces over high heat to begin with and then lower the flame. Fry until the chicken is cooked through. Drain on absorbent paper.

Heat 2 Tbsp of oil in a wok, add onions and stir-fry over high heat until they are translucent.

Add the green chillies and saute for a minute.

Add salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and the deep-fried chicken, and toss well.

Serve hot garnished with the green chillies.
